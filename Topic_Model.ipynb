    "doc1 = \"The Volkswagen emissions scandal reached the highest echelons of the company on Thursday after its former chief executive was charged with conspiracy in the company’s rigging of diesel vehicles to feign compliance with federal pollution standards.\\\n",
    "The indictment of the former executive, Martin Winterkorn, who resigned shortly after the emissions scandal erupted in September 2015, significantly raises the stakes for Volkswagen.\\\n",
    "The charges contradict the German carmaker’s steadfast insistence that no members of its management board were involved in the emissions fraud. They also weaken the company’s defense in a related suit by shareholders — potentially adding billions of dollars to the scandal’s already astronomical cost.\\\n",
    "Despite President Trump’s efforts to water down auto emissions standards, the indictment indicates that the Justice Department continues to pursue an investigation of Volkswagen that began during the Obama administration. And it provides a rare spectacle: a chief executive facing criminal charges.\\\n",
    "“If you try to deceive the United States, then you will pay a heavy price,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Thursday. “These are serious allegations, and we will prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law.”\\\n",
    "Many in the industry have long said it was implausible that the illegal software could have been installed in millions of diesel models worldwide for nearly a decade without the knowledge of top management — especially at Volkswagen, known for its top-down culture.\\\n",
    "The accusations against Mr. Winterkorn will raise further questions about the thoroughness of Volkswagen’s internal investigation of the wrongdoing. Volkswagen never made the findings public, although it had promised to do so.\\\n",
    "And the indictments provide ammunition to critics who say Volkswagen continues to rely on managers who held high-ranking positions while the wrongdoing was taking place, and who worked closely with Mr. Winterkorn. They include Hans Dieter Pötsch, the chairman of Volkswagen’s supervisory board and former chief financial officer, and Rupert Stadler, head of the Audi division.\\\n",
    "“Volkswagen continues to cooperate with investigations by the Department of Justice into the conduct of individuals,” the company said in a statement Thursday. “It would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases.”\\\n",
    "The grand jury indictment waa unsealed in Federal District Court in Detroit only hours after Volkswagen’s annual shareholders meeting in Berlin. Many shareholders complained about a lack of accountability at the top.\\\n",
    "Among the speakers was Michael Viehs, associate director of responsibility at Hermes EOS, a firm in London that represents the interests of large investors. In an interview ahead of the meeting, Mr. Viehs referred to surveys showing that even Volkswagen employees are concerned that not enough has been done to create a healthier corporate culture.\\\n",
    "“This is a little bit concerning that, three years after the emissions scandal became public, employees say they don’t see that much progress in overhauling the corporate culture,” he said.\\\n",
    "Herbert Diess, who was appointed chief executive last month, acknowledged in a speech to shareholders that Volkswagen had a lot of work to do to prevent future scandals.\\\n",
    "“Volkswagen has to become more honest, more open, more truthful,” he said. “Every large organization experiences unethical conduct and instances of noncompliance. But to speak plainly: We clearly had too much of that going on until recently.”\\\n",
    "Mr. Winterkorn, 70, is believed to be in Germany, which does not normally extradite its citizens. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, including in testimony before the German Parliament.\\\n",
    "But the United States case probably increases the chances that Mr. Winterkorn will face charges in Germany. Prosecutors there are conducting their own wide-ranging investigation, which included a raid on offices of the company’s Porsche division last month.\\\n",
    "Last year, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to United States charges that included conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act. But the company blamed lower-level managers for the wrongdoing and maintained that no members of its top management had been involved.\\\n",
    "If it is proven that Mr. Winterkorn was a party to the conspiracy, Volkswagen would be significantly more vulnerable to lawsuits brought by shareholders who accuse top managers of shirking their obligation to inform them of the risks the company was taking. The shareholders are seeking some $10 billion in damages, which would be on top of the roughly $26 billion in fines and civil damages that the carmaker has already paid.\\\n",
    "According to the indictment, Mr. Winterkorn was informed in early 2014 that regulators in the United States were asking why Volkswagen diesel vehicles had produced low emissions during laboratory tests but drastically higher emissions on the road.\\\n",
    "The indictment said Mr. Winterkorn had approved plans to conceal from regulators the true reason for the discrepancies: The cars were equipped with software, known as a defeat device, that could detect when emissions tests were underway.\\\n",
    "If the car was being tested, it deployed equipment to keep emissions within legal limits. At other times, the pollution controls were disabled or only partly deployed to protect components from wear.\""

    "A surging dollar is pressuring emerging-market countries to support their currencies by halting rate cuts or even tightening monetary policy, adding to investor concerns about growing stresses on their economies.\n",
    "Indonesia’s central bank raised rates on Wednesday, its second increase after lifting rates for the first time in four years earlier in May. Turkey’s monetary authority last month raised rates by 3 percentage points to arrest a sharp drop in its currency, while the plummeting Argentine peso forced that country’s central bank to raise rates to 40%— among the highest in the world.\n",
    "Other central banks halted a long series of cuts. Brazil’s central bank left rates unchanged for the first time in 19 months, citing concerns about global economic turbulence weakening the local currency. The South African Reserve Bank, which cut its main policy rate in March, left it unchanged in May and warned of inflation risk and weaker economic growth.\n",
    "Low oil prices and last year’s weakness in the dollar had allowed many developing countries to cut rates and boost growth without having to worry about sparking higher inflation—often a consequence of loose monetary policy.\n",
    "Now, a 5.5% rally in the dollar from its February lows and a 14.8% rise in oil prices this year have forced central banks to rethink that strategy. So have yields on U.S. government bonds, which hit multi-year highs above 3% last month, making emerging markets a less attractive option to some investors.\n",
    "A stronger U.S. dollar can dent emerging markets because it pushes down the value of their currencies, makes dollar-denominated debt more expensive to repay and increases the cost of commodities and other goods priced in dollars. That is causing anxiety at a time when investors are increasingly uncertain about the global growth picture.\n",
    "That shift comes as last year’s extraordinary pickup in world-wide growth is already meeting a number of hurdles, from concerns over global trade to higher oil prices. Investors are closely\n",
    "watching emerging markets to see how they withstand the bouts of risk aversion these pressures have sparked. Many view the asset class, where investors typically take on greater risk for greater returns, as an important barometer of global economic health.\n",
    "The MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which measures stock performance, rose 37.3% in 2017 as investors bet the eurozone would lead a revival in global expansion. Few analysts now believe that Europe will repeat its 2017 perfor- mance and recent data have been uneven. The eurozone’s annual rate of inflation hit the European Central Bank’s target for the first time in a year in May, a hopeful sign. Yet, earlier last month, Germany, Europe’s largest economy, reported that its growth had slowed sharply in the first quarter amid a drop in government spending and weak exports.\n",
    "Brazil’s central bank said last month that the lack of a fiscal overhaul to address a gaping budget deficit, currently at 7% of gross domestic product, makes the country more vulnerable to volatility. Analysts polled by the central bank in May lowered their 2018 economic growth forecast to 2.5% from 2.9% in March.\n",
    "Indonesia’s new central-bank governor last month signaled more rate increases to bolster the country’s weakening rupiah, which is hovering near its lowest level since late 2015.\n",
    "The recent volatility has spooked some investors. Emerging-market stocks and bonds have notched some $20 billion in outflows since mid-April, data from the Institute of International Finance showed. Meanwhile, the dollar has continued to march higher, fueled by political uncertainty in the eurozone and signs of steady economic growth in the U.S.\n",
    "Still, some investors believe emerging-market fundamentals remain relatively robust and the recent selloff in the asset class has provided an opportunity to buy on the cheap.\n",
    "“The policy response from emerging market authorities is picking up and supports sentiment,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. They expect Indonesia’s rate increases to buoy the rupiah.\n",

    "At the start of the last ice age, 2.6 million years ago, a sheet of frozen water formed atop North America that kept expanding and thickening until it reached a maximum depth of roughly two miles.   \n",
    "At its southern edge, the vast body deposited tons of rocky debris — from sand and pebbles to boulders the size of school buses. Then, some 18,000 years ago, the planet began to warm and the gargantuan sheet of ice began to melt and retreat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the southernmost edge of that frozen expanse is marked by a line of rubble that extends across the northern United States for thousands of miles. The largest deposits form what geologists call a terminal moraine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intermittent ridge runs from Puget Sound to the Missouri River to Montauk Point on Long Island, forming the prominence that supports its old lighthouse. The ancient sheet of ice also left its mark on a very modern phenomenon: New York City.\n",
    "The ice over Manhattan would have buried even the tallest skyscraper and was so heavy that it depressed the underlying bedrock. As it melted, giant boulders embedded deep within its flanks landed throughout what became the city. Many are still visible in Central Park, unlikely obelisks scored by time.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the island was the last hurrah, and the mammoth sheet of ice ended immediately to the south, in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. The terminal moraine, the mounds of rubble left behind, form much of their high ground.\n",
    "While the line of glacial debris across the northern United States is often poorly delineated, the hilly ridge around New York City tends to be quite prominent. Its maximum height is roughly 200 feet, about that of a tall apartment building.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rubble slowed the development of the other boroughs for centuries. Early developers sought flat land for homes and buildings and typically ignored the glacial ridges, especially their heights. Land there was too inaccessible, stony and yielding for easy construction.\n",
    "Eventually, the neglected parcels became strings of parks, cemeteries, golf courses and, in time, some of the region’s most attractive neighborhoods, often heavily landscaped and densely wooded.\n",
    "Today the ridgeline and its adjoining slopes hold Forest Park and Highland Park in Queens, as well as Prospect Park in Brooklyn. The nearby grounds of Green-Wood Cemetery include Battle Hill, a part of the glacial rise that represents the borough’s highest point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many city neighborhoods take their names from the ridge’s elevations, as well as its leafy embellishments: Glen Oaks, Hollis Hills, Jamaica Hills, Briarwood, Forest Hills, Ridgewood, Cypress Hills, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Park Slope, Greenwood, Bay Ridge, Lighthouse Hill and Arden Heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should remnants of the last ice age be so prominent in New York City, of all places?\n",
    "It started long ago as the continental ice sheet developed one of its thickest regions over what is now eastern Canada. Vast fields of ice are incredibly weighty. Gravity pushes down hard. Any tilt or slant of the underlying terrain sends the ice moving slowly downslope.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ages, the Canadian ice kept flowing into a long valley to the south that ran from the Lake Champlain area down through the Hudson River gorge. It was a reliable conduit. The river of ice and rock kept moving relentlessly southward until it hit a region warm enough to halt its slow advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "During ice ages, glaciers advance and retreat in cycles. Paths differ. But overall, the southern end of the conduit saw massive buildups of boulders and rubble.  \n",
    "In recent times, the resulting moraine got much scrutiny from scientists because of its proximity to one of the nation’s first big cities. Just as early maps of the United States often focused on New York, so did geologic inquiries — starting nearly two centuries ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the ridge’s prominence and early allure for scientists, it turned out to be no rival for skyscrapers and urban distractions. The moraine that shaped the city was all but forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Clearly, it’s not on the radar,” said David E. Seidemann, a professor of geology at Brooklyn College. “The educational system here doesn’t emphasize earth science. And there’s so much else to do. I’ll go to a Yankees game over geology any day.”\n",
    "Springtime, noted Sidney Horenstein, a geologist and environmental educator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, turns the glacial rise into a band of leafy green and opens a season favorable to its rediscovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It makes it much easier to see,” he said recently, while gazing at the ridge from the Staten Island Ferry.\n",
    "Mr. Horenstein, 81, sought to deepen the re-examination by sharing with The Times a vast trove he had assembled of scientific studies, official reports, news clippings, magazine articles and old books that mention or profile the city’s glacial relic.\n",
    "His collection also sheds light on how moraine study in general helped geologists in New York and elsewhere discover that the planet had experienced a series of ice ages. That breakthrough came in the mid 1800s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridges, mountains and even flatlands are typically rooted in rocky strata, such as the bedrock that underlies Manhattan and makes it ideal for erecting skyscrapers. But early investigators found the hilly ridges to be composed of clay, silt, sand, pebbles, cobbles and boulders, all jumbled up together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A related clue was that nearby rocks often looked quite smooth, even polished. At times, their faces also displayed parallel lines of groves and striations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1843, an official report on the natural history of New York State cited vast glaciers as a possible explanation “now attracting much attention” for what geologists were uncovering. But it also listed a dozen other theories, including “the deluge of Noah,” or the biblical flood.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the 1860s, a growing body of evidence had convinced most scientists that the Earth had endured ages in which rivers of ice transported rocks and coarse sediments over long distances — at times, it turned out, for hundreds of miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1880s, the term “ice age” was coming into wide use, and experts began looking into some of the practical consequences.\n",
    "Then in 1902, the United States Geological Survey published a large folio on metropolitan New York that detailed its rocky underpinnings, including the ridge. Multicolored maps showed the glacial rise amid emerging street grids and neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accompanying report said the rise exhibited strings of “hillocks and hollows, or interrupted ridges and troughs.” It noted that some depressions held ponds, marshes and small lakes. The report put the feature’s overall width at up to two miles.\n",
    "At first, the city used the stony ridge for woodlots and rain catchments. Slowly, the uses expanded to reservoirs, recreational areas and, in time, neighborhoods in which buildings and houses were built on strong footings and foundations for stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, despite the wide development of the ridge’s lower slopes, a Google Earth view of New York City — a composite of images from April, June and September — shows the glacial relic as an intermittent band of green.\n",
    "Talkative and outgoing, his shirt often untucked, the model of a rumpled geologist, Mr. Horenstein is a native New Yorker with boyish enthusiasm for the city’s hidden faults and early beginnings, for ancient blows and catastrophes. A compendium of geologic jokes, he refers to himself not as a raconteur but a rockconteur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though long retired, Mr. Horenstein regularly gives public tours of the city’s geology, some of them organized by the museum. Recently, at a reporter’s invitation, he turned his attention to the glacial ridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Umpire Rock in Central Park, overlooking baseball fields, the geologist noted places where glacial ice and rubble had carved massive grooves, wider than a human body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet the rock’s overall surface was quite smooth. The reason, Mr. Horenstein said, was that ages of glacial abrasion had acted like sandpaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Kids can slide down the rocks,” he said of many Central Park outcroppings.\n",
    "Throughout the park are places where the retreating ice had dropped giant boulders that geologists call erratics, after the Latin word errare, to wander. By definition, the boulders differ in composition from surrounding rocks. Some of the park’s erratics sit perched atop flat rocks, looking at times like alien monuments.\n",
    "“They’re rounded,” Mr. Horenstein said, because rivers of ice kept “dragging them around.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, on a visit to Staten Island, he pointed to the much-celebrated skyline of Lower Manhattan. Current estimates put the ice’s thickness there at roughly twice the early calculations — not 1,000 feet, but closer to 2,000 feet, and possibly more.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It was taller than any building,” Mr. Horenstein remarked, “even the Freedom Tower.” The skyscraper at the very top of its spire measures 1,776 feet high, after the nation’s birthday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward edges of glaciers can be inclined or sheer, like a cliff. Mr. Horenstein said geologists believe the local face was sheer. Its precipitous edge shed not only tons of rocky debris but gargantuan blocks of ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ice’s overall weight was so immense that it depressed the bedrock of the New York City region — and then, following the sheet’s retreat, the rocky depths slowly rebounded. Mr. Horenstein said the rise is calculated at more than 150 feet.\n",
    "At Fort Wadsworth, a historic battlement next to the Verrazano Bridge, we stood atop the moraine and looked across the Narrows, the strait between Staten Island and Brooklyn. The land that would become the two boroughs had originally been connected by the glacial ridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some 13,000 years ago, a large accumulation of icy water from melting glaciers was suddenly unleashed upstate. A towering wave of destruction crashed down through the Hudson gorge and proceeded to smash the southern end of the local moraine to smithereens.\n",
    "“It was biblical,” Mr. Horenstein said. The wave created the Narrows, which now connects the Atlantic Ocean to one of the world’s largest natural harbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the metropolitan area, the southern tip of Staten Island overlooks the Arthur Kill and Raritan Bay, and represents the southernmost part of the glacial rise. The site hosts the Conference House Park. It takes its name from an unsuccessful peace conference held there in 1776 during the Revolutionary War.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we walked past a stone manor house where the meeting took place, Mr. Horenstein pointed to the rounded rocks in its walls and, based on color and texture, proceeded to tick off their likely sites of origin —  some from upstate New York, some from New Jersey, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "What fraction came from the glacial ridge?\n",
    "\n",
    "“All of them,” he replied. “It was the local building material.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We walked down to the nearby beach and wandered a few hundred feet to where the land formed a sandy bluff. It offered a rare glimpse into the heart of the ridge: a jumble of clay, silt, pebbles and boulders in a fragile matrix laid bare by the action of tides, hurricanes and pounding waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of New York City, “this is the only place you can see the moraine clearly,” Mr. Horenstein said, leaning into the wind. “This is it, the southernmost end.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Horenstein held up a rounded stone. Somehow, it ended up in reporter’s backpack as a souvenir of the day.\n",
    "Remarkably, millions of people live on or near the glacial ridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, it runs for roughly 30 miles beneath New York City. Invisibly, it links three boroughs, offering mute testimony to the power of vanished ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ridge is lost history to most of the city’s inhabitants, at least one knows something about the art of bringing it back to life.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It keeps me young,” Mr. Horenstein said. “There’s always something to see, something you missed, something new.”\n",
